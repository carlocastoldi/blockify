# left to right, meaning to block "Bloodhound Gang - Yvan Eht Nioj", the blocklist
# entry needs to (at least) start with B.
# If you want to be able to block that song by adding "Gang" or any other substring
# within that song, set this option to True. Beware of false positives though as
# the string "Gang" could appear in a number of other songs, e.g. the track
# "Gangnam Style" would be blocked, too. Which might not be that bad, actually.
